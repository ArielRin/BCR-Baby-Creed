## Tax Features
### Distribution of Taxes
- **3% Treasury Fee:** Each transaction contributes 3% to the Treasury. These funds are earmarked for the project's long-term development and sustainability.
- **2% Auto Liquidity Pool (LP) Fee:** An additional 2% fee is added to the liquidity pool automatically. This strengthens the token's liquidity, ensuring stability and reducing price volatility.

### Reflections
- The contract also includes a mechanism for reflections, designed for future use cases. This feature allows for redistribution of tokens among holders, encouraging long-term holding and investment.

## Future Use Cases for Reflections
Reflections are a powerful feature that can be utilized in various ways, such as:
- **Rewarding Long-Term Holders:** Distributing tokens among holders, rewarding those who hold their tokens over time.
- **Stabilizing Token Price:** By redistributing tokens, it can help in stabilizing the price during volatile market conditions.

## Technical Details
- **Contract Name:** BabyCreed
- **Inheritance:** Inherits from ERC20 and Ownable, indicating a standard ERC20 token with ownership privileges.
- **Taxation Logic:** The contract implements a taxation system on transactions, where a portion of each transaction is split between the Treasury and the Auto LP.
- **Swap and Liquify:** The contract includes functions to swap tokens for Ethereum (ETH) and add to the liquidity pool, supporting the price stability of the token.

## Additional Features
- **Investment and Mutual Funds Addresses:** The contract contains mechanisms to support investment strategies through addresses dedicated to stocks and mutual funds.
- **Buyback and Burn:** The contract supports a buyback mechanism, where tokens can be bought back from the market and sent to a burn address, effectively reducing the total supply and potentially increasing the token value.

## Conclusion
The Baby Creed Token aims to create a sustainable ecosystem with its unique tax structure, supporting both the project's growth and rewarding its community. The reflections feature, while not currently active, holds potential for future applications to incentivize holding and stabilize the token's market.
